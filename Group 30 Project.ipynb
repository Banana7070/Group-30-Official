    "Being able to predict used car prices can save families thousands of dollars. By using the progam language R, we can plot graphs and get a prediction for how much a car may cost. Using a method called regression, we can predict a numerical value based on other influential factors. For example, we might be able to predict that newer cars tend to cost more than old used cars! We will predict the cost of a used car based on factors like mileage and the year of a car. To do this, we will use a dataset pulled form the web called USA_cars_datasets.csv located under Data/ section."
